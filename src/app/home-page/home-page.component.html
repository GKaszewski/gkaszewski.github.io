            <p body-1>Hi, my name is Gabriel Kaszewski and I am a High School student right now.</p>
            <p body-1>I started coding when I was 11. I taught myself programming in C++.
                But now I am a different person than I was 7 years ago. Now I write my programs in various
                languages.
                Depends on the project if I make a game, I usually go with C# and Unity Engine, if I want to make a
                mobile app
                I go with Dart and Flutter framework, for GUI applications I choose C++ and QT. I love solving
                problems and
                I hope that I'll work in one of FAANG companies in the future. I am very passionate about Computer
                Science and
                after High School, I'm planning on studying it.
            </p>
