            <h2 display-2>Who am I?</h2>
            <p body-1>Hi, my name is Gabriel Kaszewski and I am a High School student right now.</p>
            <p body-1>I started coding when I was 11. I taught myself programming in C++.
            But now I am a different person than I was 7 years ago. Now I write my programs in various languages.
            Depends on the project if I make a game, I usually go with C# and Unity Engine, if I want to make a mobile app
            I go with Dart and Flutter framework, for GUI applications I choose C++ and QT. I love solving problems and 
            I hope that I'll work in one of FAANG companies in the future. I am very passionate about Computer Science and
            after High School, I'm planning on studying it.
            </p>
